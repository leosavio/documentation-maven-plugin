[introduction]
= Introduction

Community of Practice - Getting Started Guide for `Spring-Rest-Docs` is a demostration RESTful web service which provides only some endpoints to practice api-specification documentation with spring-rest-docs.

[getting-started-running-the-service]
== Running the service
Community of Practice - Getting Started Guide for `Spring-Rest-Docs` is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd samples/rest-notes-spring-data-rest
$ ./mvnw clean package
$ java -jar target/*.jar
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/health/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response in the
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)] format:

include::{snippets}/health/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.



[getting-started-showing-the-health-status]
== Showing the health status
Now that you've started the service and verified that it works, the next step is to use
it to create a new note. As you saw above, the URI for working with notes is included as
a link when you perform a `GET` request against the root of the service:

include::{snippets}/health/http-response.adoc[]

To create a note, you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI including a JSON
payload containing the title and body of the note:

include::{snippets}/health/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created note:

include::{snippets}/health/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created note you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example,
you can access the note's details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/health/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the note's details in its body:

include::{snippets}/health/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `tags` link which we'll make use of later.
